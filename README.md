## Texture atlas importer

Plugin for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) v3.0+

Imports atlas textures from your favorite external texture packing tools to be used within Godot.

#### Supported external tools/formats
| Tool | Formats |
| ---- | ----- |

| [Attila](https://github.com/r-lyeh/attila) | `JSON` |
| [Kenney assets](http://kenney.nl/assets) | `XML` |

> NOTE: Godot does not support rotated atlas textures, so don't rotate sprites when you pack pictures with any external tools or things might not work correctly.
